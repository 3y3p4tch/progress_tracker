## Things to do:

* <b>learn SQL `(or possibly any other database language)`<b>  
`{to be done by Yash}`

***

### In ***login.php***:

> * for invalid login, display an error message
> * create databases for users ```(prof)``` containing   
> their `usernames` and `passwords` and read them

#### Possible extra things:

> * add facility for user registeration
* customise `index.php` (*empty for now*)

***

### In rest of the project:
* use database for `students` and for `prof login`
  
* use graphs, pie charts, bar graphs to show progress (will use `svg` for that)
